            <h3><li>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</li></h3>
            <p>An epic book on software craftsmanship. The book not only tells you how to write good code, but also an effective way to develop and approach software development. It is sure to change your outlook on work.
            The book describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. Several case studies of cleaning up code are valuable lessons to any developer.  <a href="clean.html">See More </a>

            <h3><li>Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</li></h3>

            <p>No matter how hard you try, the code you deliver will not be the most optimal unless improvements are made to it. Refactoring is to be made even if it working as expected.
              The book starts with general principles of refactoring: why and when to refactor, how to approach management about refactoring etc. The book then takes you through a tour of how make the improvements happen. <a href="ref.html">See More </a></p>

                <li>What are the indicator of bad smells in the code?</li>
                <li>How to structure classes, methods and other logical pieces?</li>
                <li>Unit tests for your code</li>
                <li>How to move features from one object to another?</li>

            <h3><li>Head First Design Patterns</li></h3>

            <p>The most non-technical looking book on programming! Each page contains doodles, pictures and other eye-catching stuff. That might give the impression that it is a light read, but that fact is that it is discussing quite a core topic about programming - Design patterns - and does a great job in covering the subject.
            The book does not try to cover all the patterns that exist in the world, rather it covers every pattern that you might need to solve real world problems. It will help you create functional, elegant, reusable, and flexible software. The trade-off for each patterns have been clearly pointed out. Most books on design pattern talk about how to implement the pattern, but the authors of this book also explain the why and the how. <a href="head.html">See More </a></p>

            <h3><li>Soft Skills: The Software Developer's Life Manual</li></h3>

            <p>A great book on managing "other" aspects of developers life. It's about everything there could be in your life - It’s about your career, life, body, mind, and believe it or not - soul as well.
              The author himself has followed these techniques and is quite successful at that. His website says that he was able to quit his day job in his early 30's. The author has culminated his life's experiences in neatly divided short chapters on Career, Marketing yourself, Learning, Productivity, Finances, Fitness and Spirit. Each chapter is short enough to be read on a coffee break, that makes it a fairly light read. <a href="soft.html">See More </a></p>
