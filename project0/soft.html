        <h3> Soft Skills: The Software Developer's Life Manual </h3>
        </div>

        <p>Everybody has read a decent amount of books about technical subjects, like programming languages, design patterns, best practices, etc. This is no different for me, which eventually led to a feeling which I can best describe as hitting some sort of ceiling. I've been a software engineer for about 15 years now and have been focusing on getting better at programming for most of this time. Don't get me wrong, I don't know everything about the languages I use, I don't know all the principles or patterns by heart, but I usually know how to find the things I need. I think this all got me thinking that if I want to grow a little in this area I'd have to deep dive some advanced areas, which means investing a lot of time. Sort of like the remaining part of the 80/20 rule.<br>
          So I was pleasantly surprised when this book crossed my path on a list of books that were suggested by a fellow software engineer. It pictured me the image that I'd probably liked coding and had that area covered, but what about the remaining part of the life as a software engineer? I say the remaining part of the life with a reason, since a lot of books focus on areas like talking to clients or job interviews, but this book promises to look at a whole facet of things in the life of a software engineer, besides coding. So I've started reading last month and now I'd love to share with you my opinion about this book.<br>

        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p>Starting with the conclusion? Am I insane? Not at all, I'm going to give you my honest opinion about the book, so you can decide for yourself if it's interesting enough. If you still want more, than you can read my deep dive through the chapters. I'd rather you spent the time reading a good book than a review, so just decide for yourself how far you'll read.<br>
        <p>When you read the book you'll feel that John Sonmez's intent is to share his years of experience in life with you. He looks at things like dealing with clients, peers and managers, but also at finding love, finances, productivity and staying in shape. The chapters are divided into 7 major sections which I will handle further on. The writing style is easy to read, the chapters are really small which allows for quickly reading one when you have 15 minutes or half an hour to spare. It's full of practical examples, personal stories and assignments to help you get started to bettering your life. When you've read more books about the same subjects, you'll notice a lot of similarity between popular techniques, but in a more simple and practical way. A lot of it feels very familiar, while some of the area's feel only unusable unless you live in the United States or a country where culture and finances are similar. And some chapters depend on where you are in your career for them to be useful, but again, most parts are really good, I think about 70% of the books is in some way applicable to most software engineers.
