<h2> Description </h2>

<p>
his project was made to become the basis of a book promotion project.
On the initial page, I put a table to enumerate the books and their respective authors that would be addressed on the page. Below I applied the summaries of each book as a list and added static images for each one.<br>
The user has the option to read more content about the books by clicking on "See More".<br>
When entering each review page, the other books will be listed for the user to check other reviews if he wants.<br>
In the future, this website template may be more elaborate, using comments, user registration, and notes system.<br>
